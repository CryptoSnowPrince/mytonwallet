**The most feature-rich web wallet and browser extension for [TON Network](https://ton.org)** â€“ with support of jettons, NFT, TON DNS, TON Sites, TON Proxy, and TON Magic.

The wallet is **non-custodial and safe**. The developers **do not** have access to funds, browser history or any other information. We focus on **speed**, **size** and **attention to detail**. We try to avoid using third-party libraries to ensure maximum reliability and safety and also to lower bundle size. 

## Local setup
